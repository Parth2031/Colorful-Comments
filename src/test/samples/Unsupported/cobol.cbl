AUTHOR.  Michael Coughlan.
* Demonstrates the use of the PERFORM..UNTIL.
* The PERFORM..UNTIL is most often used to process a 
* stream of data where the length of the stream can not 
* be determined in advance.
* Pay particular attention to the way the number stream is 
* processed in this program.
* Note how the ON SIZE ERROR can be used to detect when the
* result of a computation is tot big for the data-item intended
* to hold it.
* The INITIALIZE verb sets a data-item to its initial or 
* starting value.
*> ^ Check if this format is correct
